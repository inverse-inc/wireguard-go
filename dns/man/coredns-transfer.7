\fBZONE\fP The zones \fItransfer\fP will answer zone transfer requests for. If left blank, the zones
are inherited from the enclosing server block. To answer zone transfers for a given zone,
there must be another plugin in the same server block that serves the same zone, and implements
\fB\fCtransfer.Transferer\fR.
.IP \(bu 4
\fB\fCto\fR \fBADDRESS...\fP The hosts \fItransfer\fP will transfer to. Use \fB\fC*\fR to permit transfers to all
addresses. \fBADDRESS\fP must be denoted in CIDR notation (e.g., 127.0.0.1/32) or just as plain
addresses. \fB\fCto\fR may be specified multiple times.
