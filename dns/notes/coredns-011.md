CoreDNS-011 has been [released](https://github.com/inverse-inc/wireguard-go/dns/releases/tag/v011)!

CoreDNS is a DNS server that chains plugins, where each plugin implements a DNS feature.

Release v011 is a major release, with backwards incompatible changes in the *kubernetes* plugin.

## Core

**This release has backwards incompatible changes** for the *kubernetes* plugin.

* Stop vendoring `github.com/miekg/dns` and `golang.org/x/net/context`. This enables external plugin to compile without tripping over vendored types that mismatch.
* Allow an easy way to specify reverse zones in the Corefile, just use (e.g) `10.0.0.0/24` as the zone name,
  CoreDNS translates this to 0.0.10.in-addr.arpa. This is only done when the netmask is a multiple of 8 and for both IPv4 and IPv6.
* Bug and stability fixes.

## Plugins

Make *kubernetes*, *file*, *secondary*, *hosts*, *erratic* and *metrics* now fail on unknown properties in the Corefile.

### New

* *federation*: enables federation via kubernetes.
* *autopath*: enables autopath-ing. Can be used standalone, but its main use is with kubernetes.

### Updates

* *log* adds an `>rflags` replacer that shows the flags from the response - this has been enabled by default.
* *kubernetes* deprecates:
   * `cidr`: use the reverse syntax in the Corefile
   * `federation`: use the new *federation* plugin
   * `autopath`: use the new *autopath* plugin
* *kubernetes*:
   * add TTL option allowing to set minimal TTL for responses.
   * Multiple k8s API endpoints could be specified, separated by `","`s, e.g. `endpoint http://k8s-endpoint1:8080,http://k8s-endpoint2:8080`. CoreDNS will automatically perform a healthcheck and proxy to the healthy k8s API endpoint.
* *rewrite*:
   * allow for *dynamic* properties to be used, like client IP address in rewrite rules, i.e.
`rewrite edns0 local set 0xffee {client_ip}`
   * add support for EDNS0 Client Subnet
* *dnstap* now reports messages proxied by *proxy*, and support remote IP endpoints by specifying `tcp://`.
* *dnssec* now warns if keys can't be used to sign the configured zones.
* *health* now allows for per plugin health status; no plugin makes use of this yet, though.
* *secondary* parses a secondary with a zone (`secondary example.org {...}`) correctly.
