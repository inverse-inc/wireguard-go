The CoreDNS team has released
[CoreDNS-1.7.0](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.7.0).

This is a **backwards-incompatible release**. Major changes include:

* Better [metrics names](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/pull/3776).
* The *federation* plugin (which allows for v1 Kubernetes federation) has been removed. We've also removed
  some supporting code from the *kubernetes* plugin, so it will not build as an external plugin
  (with this version of CoreDNS).

As this was already backwards-incompatible release, we took the liberty of stuffing as much in
one release as possible to minimize the disruption going forward.

A new plugin, [*dns64*](https://coredns.io/plugins/dns64), was promoted from external to a plugin that
is included by default. This plugin "enables DNS64 IPv6 transition mechanism."

### Metric Changes

We mostly dropped `count` from `_total` metrics names:

* `coredns_request_block_count_total` -\> `coredns_dns_blocked_requests_total`
* `coredns_request_allow_count_total` -\> `coredns_dns_allowed_requests_total`

* `coredns_dns_acl_request_block_count_total` -\> `coredns_acl_blocked_requests_total`
* `coredns_dns_acl_request_allow_count_total` -\> `coredns_acl_allowed_requests_total`

* `coredns_autopath_success_count_total` -\> `coredns_autopath_success_total`

* `coredns_forward_request_count_total` -\> `coredns_forward_requests_total`
* `coredns_forward_response_rcode_count_total` -\> `coredns_forward_responses_total`
* `coredns_forward_healthcheck_failure_count_total` -\> `coredns_forward_healthcheck_failures_total`
* `coredns_forward_healthcheck_broken_count_total` -\> `coredns_forward_healthcheck_broken_total`
* `coredns_forward_max_concurrent_reject_count_total` -\> `coredns_forward_max_concurrent_rejects_total`

* `coredns_grpc_request_count_total` -\> `coredns_grpc_requests_total`
* `coredns_grpc_response_rcode_count_total` -\> `coredns_grpc_responses_total`

* `coredns_panic_count_total` -\> `coredns_panics_total`
* `coredns_dns_request_count_total` -\> `coredns_dns_requests_total`
* `coredns_dns_request_do_count_total` -\> `coredns_dns_do_requests_total`
* `coredns_dns_response_rcode_count_total` -\> `coredns_dns_responses_total`

* `coredns_reload_failed_count_total` -\> `coredns_reload_failed_total`

* `coredns_cache_size` -\> `coredns_cache_entries`

And note that
`coredns_dns_request_type_count_total` is now part of `coredns_dns_requests_total` .
