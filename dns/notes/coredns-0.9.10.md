CoreDNS-0.9.10 has been [released](https://github.com/inverse-inc/wireguard-go/dns/releases/tag/v0.9.10)!

CoreDNS is a DNS server that chains plugins, where each plugin implements a DNS feature.

Release 0.9.10 is a minor release, with some fixes.

## Core

* The reverse zone syntax was extended to allow non-octet boundaries:

   ~~~
   192.168.1.0/17 {
       ...
   }
   ~~~

   Will behave correctly.

* Lots of documentation clean ups.
* More platforms have binaries for each release.

## Plugins

* *dnssec* will now insert DS records (and sign them) when it signs a delegation response.
* *host* now checks for /etc/hosts updates in a separate go-routine.
